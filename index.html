      Denticles found on shark skin, are being used in current engineering projects to decrease the friction from air resistance and turn the drag force into a forward speed enhancement. Their flexibility in movement and close to net zero mass make them excellent candidates for improving aerospace projects. The physics behind this evolutionary advantage puts sharks at the top of the oceanic food chain and soon could be helping to cut fuel emissions from large transport vehicles; as well as improving sport performance and everyday travel efficiency. Aside from currently being used in aquasport equipment, shark denticles are an unexplored phenomenon of nature which humans could greatly befit from adapting into our society.
