        Denticles found on shark skin, are being used in current engineering projects to decrease the friction from air resistance and turn the drag force into a forward speed enhancement.
        Their flexibility in movement and close to net zero mass make them excellent candidates for improving aerospace projects.
        The physics behind this evolutionary advantage puts sharks at the top of the oceanic food chain and soon could be helping to cut fuel emissions from large transport vehicles;
        as well as improving sport performance and everyday travel efficiency.
        Aside from currently being used in aquasport equipment, shark denticles are an unexplored phenomenon of nature which humans could greatly befit from adapting into our society.

        The earliest shark fossil dates back 450 million years ago, in the Ordovician period, the same time the first plants could survive on earth.
        91 million years later the Hangenberg event wiped out 70%-80% of warm water marine communities, this led to the “Golden age of sharks”.
        After surviving all mass global extinction events, the shark’s evolution has seen them reach and dominate the marine food chain.
        As the apex predator of the ocean, the evolution of a shark’s hunting behaviour and physical attributes have been studied to understand why they are so successful.
        Despite being only the fourth fastest shark, the Great White is recorded to have an 80% success rate when it comes to catching prey.
        The fastest shark is the Shortfin Mako, nicknamed the “Peregrine Falcon of the sea” (Bartoli, 2021),
        these sharks have a “top speed of 46mph and have been recorded to jump 20 feet out of the water to catch prey” (Oceana, no date).
        This jumping behaviour is known as breaching, this is made possible by the Shortfin’s design.
        They have an extremely hydrodynamic build with a torpedo, conical style nose and a lunate shape caudal fin which generates the power.
        Denticles, or Placoid scales, can be found on all sharks and some types of rays.
        Shortfin Makos are covered in millions of miniature dermal-denticles which decrease the friction of their movement against water.

        Figure (a) shows the design of a shark’s dermal denticle from a diagonal side view. The base of the denticle is wider than the neck,
        this is because the denticles are spaced to maximise the flow of water in-between them, pushing the water to create the thrust force.
        Figure (b) depicts DL (Denticle Length), RS (Riblet Spacing) and DW (Denticle Width), from a top view. 
      
        The Mako’s design has evolved one step further in comparison to their cousin, the great white.
        The Shortfin has “flexible scales” notably on the edges of their main fins (the pectoral and dorsal).
        Flexibility in these areas act similarly to the rear wing of a racing car where a DRS flap would open to reduce drag.
        The backwards “tooth shape” design of the denticles increase the water flow around the areas of high dermal-denticle density.
        This is what helps to make the Shortfin Mako the highest predator on the pelagic food web, with adult sharks being prey to no known animal (other than humans).

  <p class="ex1">

        Sharks famously attack from below, swimming up from beneath to surprise and ambush their prey. This is only practical because of their denticles.
        Denticles make the movement of shark’s quieter (Yirka, 2024) this is due to their design.
        The notable characteristics of denticles include their higher middle ridge with smaller ridges on each side.  When researching white shark denticles,
        it was discovered that they commonly formed of high ridges and large spacing, meaning drag was reduced, on average, by 2.3 ms¯¹.
        This was then compared to denticles of adjacent high and low ridges with a smaller gap, the average reduced drag was 5.1 ms¯¹.
        This calculation method was later applied to the shortfin makos denticles and estimated the drag reduction at 10.5 ms¯¹
        (Sayama, S.et al (2024) 'Three-dimensional shape of natural riblets in the white shark: relation between the denticle morphology and swimming speed of sharks',
        Journal of the royal society interface, Volume 21 Issue 217. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2024.0063).
        One of the biggest advantages of the denticle is its flexibility, this allows for a movement called ‘Bristling’.
        Bristling can only occur because the denticles can move up to 50 degrees from their original orientation.
        Pressure drag is decreased as the flexibility of the scales can control flow separation; this means when the flow of water is reversed from the original orientation of the denticles,
        they can move to create a small direction change in the water flow, enhancing their forwards thrust force.

       Scientists researched the performance benefits of denticles 2mm wide and spaced 1mm apart. It was discovered that overall,
       a shark’s denticles created a lift-to-drag ratio of up to 323% in comparison to a ‘smooth control foil’. This design was then taken and applied to water sport equipment,
       most famously an aerofoil, as well as a swimsuit which was later banned from the Olympics. (Dommel, G.et al (2018) ‘Shark skin-inspired designs that improve aerodynamic performance’,
       Journal of the royal society interface, Volume 15, Issue 139). It was also found that denticle size had an impact on power consumption.
       Smaller dermal denticles can reduce power consumption and increase the self-propelled swimming speed of the shark. However bigger,
       less flexible denticles reduced swimming performance in comparison (August G Domel et al 2018 Bioinspir. Biomim. 13 056014)

  <p class="ex1">

        The human uses of denticles aren’t just limited to the water, in 2010 it was published that scientists at IFAM had developed a paint (and the technology to mass produce it)
        which mimics a sharks denticles. This had major benefits, not only in reducing aerodynamic drag but for environmental factors as it reduces CO2 emissions and costs.
        They calculated that if every airplane, every year, throughout the world could apply this paint; we could save 4.48 million tons of fuel.
        This paint could also be applied to any vehicle and produce the same benefits (Wilke, Y. et al. (2010 topic 4)) 
        The main reason denticles aren’t more commonly used in aircraft is because as an aircraft takes off, its ability to fly comes from
        the surface area of the wing causing a pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the wing. This causes the lift without having to have a push/drive through the air,
        like a shark has through water. This would end up consuming more energy than the denticles would save therefore becoming ineffective.
        Instead, it could be used in automotive designs, it would be most effective in higher speed vehicles as the denticles create the most thrust enhancement when they have a higher resistance against them.
