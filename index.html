       Denticles found on shark skin, are being used in current engineering projects to decrease the friction from air resistance and turn the drag force into a forward speed enhancement.
       Their flexibility in movement and close to net zero mass make them excellent candidates for improving aerospace projects.
       The physics behind this evolutionary advantage puts sharks at the top of the oceanic food chain and soon could be helping to cut fuel emissions from large transport vehicles; as well as improving sport performance and everyday travel efficiency.
       Aside from currently being used in aquasport equipment, shark denticles are an unexplored phenomenon of nature which humans could greatly befit from adapting into our society.

        The earliest shark fossil dates back 450 million years ago, in the Ordovician period, the same time the first plants could survive on earth. 91 million years later the Hangenberg event wiped out 70%-80% of warm water marine communities, this led to the “Golden age of sharks”.
        After surviving all mass global extinction events, the shark’s evolution has seen them reach and dominate the marine food chain. As the apex predator of the ocean, the evolution of a shark’s hunting behaviour and physical attributes have been studied to understand why they are so successful.
        Despite being only the fourth fastest shark, the Great White is recorded to have an 80% success rate when it comes to catching prey. The fastest shark is the Shortfin Mako, nicknamed the “Peregrine Falcon of the sea” (Bartoli, 2021), these sharks have a “top speed of 46mph and have been recorded to jump 20 feet out of the water to catch prey” (Oceana, no date).
        This jumping behaviour is known as breaching, this is made possible by the Shortfin’s design. They have an extremely hydrodynamic build with a torpedo, conical style nose and a lunate shape caudal fin which generates the power.
        Denticles, or Placoid scales, can be found on all sharks and some types of rays. Shortfin Makos are covered in millions of miniature dermal-denticles which decrease the friction of their movement against water.
   
//ADD FIGURE

        Figure (a) shows the design of a shark’s dermal denticle from a diagonal side view. The base of the denticle is wider than the neck, this is because the denticles are spaced to maximise the flow of water in-between them, pushing the water to create the thrust force.
        Figure (b) depicts DL (Denticle Length), RS (Riblet Spacing) and DW (Denticle Width), from a top view. 
      
        The Mako’s design has evolved one step further in comparison to their cousin, the great white. The Shortfin has “flexible scales” notably on the edges of their main fins (the pectoral and dorsal).
        Flexibility in these areas act similarly to the rear wing of a racing car where a DRS flap would open to reduce drag. The backwards “tooth shape” design of the denticles increase the water flow around the areas of high dermal-denticle density.
        This is what helps to make the Shortfin Mako the highest predator on the pelagic food web, with adult sharks being prey to no known animal (other than humans).
